# Customer Segmentation using SQL + RFM Analysis

This project uses real transactional data to segment customers using the RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) model and basic SQL skills â€” helping businesses understand customer behavior and take smarter marketing actions.

---

## Objectives

- Clean and prepare transaction data
- Use **SQL** to calculate Recency, Frequency, and Monetary values
- Score customers on RFM scale (1â€“5)
- Segment customers into actionable groups: Champions, Loyal, At Risk, etc.
- Visualize the distribution of customer segments

---

## Dataset

- Dataset: Online Retail II  
- Columns used: `CustomerID`, `InvoiceDate`, `InvoiceNo`, `Quantity`, `Price`
- Cleaned using Python (missing values, non-positive amounts removed)

---

## Tools Used

- **SQL**: For RFM calculations directly in the database
- **Python (Pandas + Matplotlib)**: For RFM scoring and segment tagging
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For analysis and documentation

---

## Key Segments Created

- **Champions** â€“ High spenders, frequent, recent
- **Loyal** â€“ Frequent buyers
- **At Risk** â€“ Havenâ€™t purchased in a while
- **Hibernating** â€“ Inactive, low value
- **New Customers** â€“ Recent but not yet active
